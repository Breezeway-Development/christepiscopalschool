    <p class="PageTitle" style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Christ
    Episcopal School</p>

    <p class="BodyCopy" style="text-align: justify;">For twenty-five years,
    Christ Episcopal School has sought to live out its mission with a humble
    earnestness of purpose. Throughout that time our campus has continued to
    develop into an environment where each person's uniqueness is intrinsically
    valued. We seek to remember and act upon the definitive belief that each
    child manifests God's creative love passing through the prism of the
    parents, and refracts a new manifestation of "God in the World." Therefore
    each student is a wonder; "called by name." God called each of our children
    by name before we knew they were ours. So, we seek not to manage but guide
    them through wisdom, opportunity, encouragement and, yes, mandates to
    progress through recognized developmental goals on the intellectual,
    spiritual, moral, social, and physical planes.</p>

    <p class="BodyCopy" style="text-align: justify;">We also seek to act
    justly, and for us, the model to emulate in doing so is the Spirit of
    Christ. People who act for justice though do not ignore or allow repetitive
    acts of self-centeredness that are harmful to others or one's own self. We
    look for and seek in worship, reflection, and thought, the moral courage
    within ourselves and our students to both know the "good" and to choose the
    "good" as we move through the years together sharing both joys and
    trials.</p>

    <p class="BodyCopy" style="text-align: justify;">Finally, we are
    clearly&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">about</span>
    something everyday. We are about learning. We seek a level of engagement in
    learning by which we measure our effectiveness. We seek a productive and
    invigorating marriage of a work ethic and intellectual curiosity. We expect
    and look for joy in and out of the classroom as we pursue high
    expectations, inculcate a lifelong love of learning and critical and
    reflective thought within relationship-based teaching.</p>

    <p class="BodyCopy" style="text-align: justify;">While we recognize and
    honor the responsibility, we take great pleasure in being so proximate to
    our children's development. We relish the relationships, the trust and the
    opportunity to weave the fabric of our community while valuing each thread
    as precious in the philosophical, theological and personal sense. I invite
    you to contact us and explore the web site to learn more about our school.
